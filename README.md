# Words of Wisdom App
I love quotes. Who doesn't?

Now you can select your favorite quotes, add them in my app and then see them in a widget every time you turn on your phone screen. 

It works offline, because the database is created by you. You have the power to create. 

It's developed using Clean Architecture (or at least this is what I wanted to do).

Keep close to see the version 1.0 in the store.

PS: The point of this project is for me to learn how to create a Widget. Yes, I want to see the quotes I love on my smartphone home screen.
